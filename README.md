# awsing (aws-ing)

As an AWS enthusiast, I enjoy experimenting with AWS services for learning and exploration. To make my work reproducible and easy to revisit, I maintain everything as code.

This repository contains my AWS workloads. It includes a variables YAML file that allows features to be easily enabled or disabled based on current needs. This approach helps minimize costs by ensuring that unnecessary services are not running.
